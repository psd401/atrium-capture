# Verification record

This file records reproducible local evidence for milestone exit gates. A milestone is listed as complete only after its stated gate passes; planned CI or source inspection alone is not counted as runtime evidence.

## M0 — complete (2026-07-22)

- `pnpm contracts:check`: all three Draft 2020-12 schemas compile with strict AJV settings and the shared capture-session, native-bridge, and publish-job fixtures validate.
- `pnpm test`: TypeScript tests load the generated contract types, verify metadata-only bridge content, and prove the input fixture contains intent rather than a typed value.
- `swift test --package-path apps/macos` in the official `swift:6.0-bookworm` environment: Swift 6 compiles the generated models and all three XCTest fixture decodes pass (3 tests, 0 failures).
- `swiftc -frontend -parse`: the installed Apple Swift 6.3.3 parser accepts generated and test sources. Direct local XCTest execution is unavailable on this workstation because Command Line Tools contains a 6.3.3 compiler with a 6.3.2 SDK and no full Xcode; the container supplies independent compile/decode evidence rather than weakening the gate.
- `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, generation freshness, and `git diff --check` pass.
- `pnpm licenses:check` accepts only the reviewed license groups. `pnpm security:audit` reports no known vulnerabilities.
- Synthetic fixture site, threat model, immutable platform identifiers, OAuth registration plan, dependency review, and CI workflows are committed.

Exit-gate conclusion: the identical `capture-session-v1.json` fixture validates in TypeScript and decodes through generated Swift `Codable` models. Platform code has no second handwritten contract model.
